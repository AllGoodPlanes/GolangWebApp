Upto & including stage 6:   
	Added Home, About, Register & Signin pages

    Added browser-side javascript registration input verification  
    Added Server-side (Golang) registration input verification - including check for duplicate e.mails & usernames  
    e.g. all essential info' requested has been input, all requested elements of the password included - numbers, length etc
